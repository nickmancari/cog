# A Command Line Tool:
<p>Cog is a tool to replace folders of one-line bash scripts. You can condense folders of scripts into one cog file and use the Cog tool to run the one-liners instead. A great way to organize common commands and processes.</p>

<br>

<p>It's a replica of <a href="https://github.com/nickmancari/valet">valet</a> but written in Rust</p>

<br>

## Quick Example:
run a command with cog:
```
$ cog command
```
Flags are not necessary. You only need to pass your defined command to cog.
